#+TITLE: Capture and attach files to org-mode

Helper function and desktop file aimed to automate process of capturing and
  attaching files from file system directly to the org-mode.

* Install

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package org-attach-file)
#+end_src

* KDE

Install desktop file to system:
#+begin_src sh
# Using GNU Stow (https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
stow -t ~ var

# .. or linking it by hands
mkdir -p ~/bin
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/
ln -s $(realpath var/bin/org-attach-file) ~/bin/org-attach-file
ln -s $(realpath var/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/emacs-file-capture.desktop) \
      ~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/emacs-file-capture.desktop

# Update desktop data base
update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
#+end_src

This installation process assumes you are working with KDEv5 environment and
  that folder =~/bin= is in your ~$PATH~ variable. While the desktop file will
  possibly work with other file managers and DEs, the destination folder is
  certainly different.

* Doom emacs

Package recipe:
#+begin_src elisp
(package! org-attach-file-capture
  :recipe (:repo "mskorzhinskiy/org-attach-file-capture"
           :host github :branch "main"))
#+end_src

* Usage

After installing, you should be able to see "Attach to org-mode" menu when
  you'll right-clock file in KDE file managers, like Dolphin. Pressing this
  button will pop up a frame with capture templates.

- Supports sending multiply files at once (each file gets its own heading and ID);
- Separate variable for file capture templates;
- Capture is always immediately ends after pressing "Attach to org-mode".
